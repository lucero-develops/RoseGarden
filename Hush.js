a = 42;

//your assigning to a variable that has never been foramlly 
//declared , this is a really bad idea 
// every variable you use in your program should been formally
//declared before the first time you use it 

// var a;
// a = 42;
// same as 

var a = 42; 
//dont houst,  var is function scooping defs

//block scooping definantions
let b = 2;
const c = 43;


function a(){}

//These are the four ways to declare variable
