/*
Creating a Java script file from Scratch

the index.html you could load the script tag
in the <head> but its is recommended to add your
<script> right before the closing <body> tag

The reason for this is because our code is read from top to bottom 
by the browser, it will render everthing else on the page before it loads
our scripts , which makes the page load much faster 
add in addition if there are any errors in our Java script file
its going to render the content before the running the script



<script src ="js/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
